# backend_v2

A from-scratch rewrite of `backend/`, built to be **fast, observable, and impossible to hang**.
The old `backend/` is untouched, so the two can be compared side by side.

## What is different

| Old backend | backend_v2 |
|---|---|
| Claims processed one after another | Claims run concurrently (`CLAIM_CONCURRENCY`) |
| Up to 5 searches + 12 page downloads + a Chromium launch per page, per claim | Arda's new `retrieval_demo_lite` (3 searches, 8 plain page downloads, no browser, no ML models), with the downloads run **in parallel** |
| torch + sentence-transformers + Chromium in the image (~2 GB+) | Only `fastapi`, `groq`, `tavily-python` |
| No time limit: a slow request just dies at the frontend's timeout | Hard deadline (`TOTAL_TIMEOUT`): always answers, with partial results if needed |
| Any error becomes the same generic 500 | Each claim reports its own `status`, `error_code`, `failed_stage`, and (optionally) `detail` |
| Missing API key crashes the server at startup | Server starts, `/health` and `/verify` say exactly which variable is missing |
| gpt-oss "thinks" at default effort | `reasoning_effort=low` (auto-disabled if Groq rejects it) |
| Same claim re-researched every time | In-memory cache (6 h), Turkish-aware key |
| No way to see what is slow | `timings` in every response + `/health/deep` |

`ai-engine/ai_engine.py` and `retrieval_demo_lite/search_retrieval_lite.py` are reused as-is (imported, never copied
or edited), so there is one copy of the prompts and one copy of the retrieval logic, and `git pull` never conflicts.

The lite module downloads its pages one after another; `LiteRetriever` (in `app/retrieval.py`) wraps two of its
internal functions so they run in parallel (4.1 s -> 0.5 s in a simulated test, same sources chosen). If Arda later
parallelises the module himself, that wrapper can simply be deleted.

## Run locally (Windows)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Mert\Desktop\verify
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r backend_v2\requirements.txt
copy backend_v2\.env.example backend_v2\.env     # then fill in the two keys
cd backend_v2
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000/health/deep>. It makes one tiny real call to Groq and to Tavily and
tells you how long each took, or the exact error. **If something is wrong, start there.**

Tests (no network, no keys needed): `python tests/test_pipeline.py`

## API

- `GET /health` – config and which keys are set (never the keys)
- `GET /health/deep` – live latency / error check of Groq and Tavily
- `POST /verify` `{"text": "..."}` – same shape as before. New fields: `partial`, `timings`, and per claim
  `status` (`ok` | `error` | `timeout` | `skipped`), `error_code`, `failed_stage`, `detail`, `cached`, `timings_ms`.
  A claim with `status != "ok"` has `verdict: null`, so the frontend must not show it as a real verdict.
- `POST /verify/stream` – Server-Sent Events: `claims` (immediately), one `result` per claim as it finishes,
  then `done`. Lets the UI show claims and verdicts as they arrive instead of one long spinner.
  (Use `fetch` + a stream reader on the frontend; `EventSource` cannot POST.)

## Choosing the retriever (`RETRIEVER` in `.env`)

| Value | What it is | Speed | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lite` (default) | Arda's `retrieval_demo_lite` | medium | `requests`, `beautifulsoup4` |
| `tavily` | one Tavily search, uses its snippets only | fastest, thinnest evidence | nothing extra |
| `arda` | Arda's old heavy pipeline (embeddings + cross-encoder + browser) | slowest | torch, sentence-transformers, ... |

Run the same texts with different values and compare `timings` and the sources. For `lite`, `LITE_QUERY_COUNT=2`
is the easiest extra speed-up (see `.env.example`).

## Deploying

Make sure `retrieval_demo_lite/` is committed (the image copies it). Build from the **repo root**: `docker build -f backend_v2/Dockerfile -t verify-backend .`
On Render/Railway: Dockerfile path `backend_v2/Dockerfile`, build context = repository root, and set
`GROQ_API_KEY` and `TAVILY_API_KEY` in the dashboard. Set `EXPOSE_ERROR_DETAIL=0` once things are stable.

## Known limits

- The cache and rate-limiting are per process (fine for one instance; use Redis if you scale out).
- Python threads that are already waiting on Groq/Tavily when a request times out cannot be killed; their
  result is simply discarded.
- With `RETRIEVER=tavily`, Tavily snippets are shorter than full pages, so evidence is thinner (speed/depth trade-off).
- The lite module still runs its 3 Tavily searches one after another (about 1-2 s each).
